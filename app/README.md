#$\mu\delta$

###Welcome to the $\mu\delta$ editor
The point of this project, aside from my own education in Chrome Packaged Apps, is provide and editor that combines the quick rich text authoring of Markdown and the equation rendering of Tex.

Some $\mu\delta$ tricks

&#8984;+p print the rendered result (chrome allows you to print to pdf as well, set margins to none if you don't want the header footer info)

&#8984;+s Save

&#8984;+o Open

&#8984;+n New (File and window.. I'll add tabs someday)

&#8984;+b __markdown bold__

&#8984;+i *markdown italic*

&#8984;+k `Markdown code`

&#8984;+k 3 times and a language name:
```javascript
var hello = 'world';
```
gives you a code block with synatx highlighting.

&#8984;+u ~Markdown strikethrough~
